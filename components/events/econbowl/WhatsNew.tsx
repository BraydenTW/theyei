            In a step-up from the past two years, two different competition tracks are now open to EconBowl competitors: Team & Individual. Please keep in mind that you have the option of participating in the team track, the individual track, or both! To ensure that all competitors are on a level playing field, teams will only be competing against individuals. Seperate prize pools, which are now larger than ever, have been established for each track!
